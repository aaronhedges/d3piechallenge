# API LOGIN & DS3 PIE Chart challenge

## GOALS ##

Develop a small tool using your preferred technology, that implements the following requirements:

- Login on our Test-Environment

- Query the gender of all users

- Show this data in a pie-chart (other visualizations are optional)

- Optional: Provide your tool as a docker container

 

As a part of our backend we use “parse-server”. It is a framework that provides a REST-API and there are client-libraries for many platforms. The documentation is available here: http://parseplatform.org/

Our Test-Environment is available here: xxx
